### Initialization

The `reverseBits` method takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a result variable `res` to `0`. This variable will store the reversed bits of `n`.

### Looping Through Bits

A `for` loop runs 32 times to process each bit of `n`, from LSB to MSB. In each iteration, the current result (`res`) is shifted left by one bit to make space for the next bit.

### Extracting and Shifting Bits

The least significant bit (LSB) of `n` is added to `res` using the bitwise OR operation (`res |= (n & 1)`). Then, `n` is right-shifted by one bit using the unsigned right shift operator (`>>>`). This operator is used instead of the signed right shift operator (`>>`) to ensure that `n` is treated as an unsigned integer, avoiding issues with negative values.

### Final Result

After the loop, `res` contains the reversed bits of the original integer. The method returns `res`, giving the correct reversed bit representation.
