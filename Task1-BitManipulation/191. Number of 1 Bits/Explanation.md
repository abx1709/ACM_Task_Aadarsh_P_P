### Problem Overview
Given a 32-bit unsigned integer, return the count of its set bits.

### Initialization
A counter variable `count` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the number of `1` bits.

### Looping Through Bits
The method enters a `while` loop that continues until `n` becomes `0`. (It is given that `n` is a positive integer)

In each iteration:
- The least significant bit (LSB) of `n` is checked using the bitwise AND operation (`n & 1`). If this bit is `1`, `count` is incremented.
- `n` is then right-shifted by one bit (`n >>= 1`) to process the next bit in the subsequent iteration.

### Final Result
Once all bits have been processed, the method returns the total count of `1` bits in `n`.
